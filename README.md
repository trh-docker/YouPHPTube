# YOUR OWN TUBE WEBSITE

YouPHPTube (YPT) is an open source solution that is freely available to everyone. The idea came from the need to 
disseminate videos with sensitive content using the internal, network infrastructure of an institution. Soon the 
idea grew and took up space on the internet, as an alternative to itself to replace, in a distributed way, the 
great video sites like: YouTube, Vimeo, etc. With YouPHPTube, you can create your own video sharing site as well 
as stream live videos, always inspired by the latest technologies. Among some of the features, YouPHPTube allows 
you to import and encode videos from other sites directly from the Internet, as well as support for mobile 
devices, through the responsive layout of the site or through a hybrid application that allows you to directly 
view and stream videos of your phone.
